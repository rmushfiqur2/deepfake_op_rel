D3 swap_gen_folder_path = '../data_deepfake/face-cacd-gan-using5-9-swapped-2ndhalf'
D1 orig_folder_path = '../data_deepfake/face-cacd'

We want dis(D1,D2) to be large, but dis(D22,D3) to be small

D2 is far different from D22

D2 is like Obama -> fake Obama
D22 is like Mushfiq -> Obama
D1 Obama
D11 Mushfiq
D3 Mushfiq -> Obama -> Obama

One option is D11 -> D22 -> D3 
Another option is D1 -> D2

In test purpose D2 has no value. Goal is to separate D1 and D22 or to separate (D1,D2) and (D22,D3)
in inference we were separating (D11,D22)(high) and (D22,D3)(low) with DatasetBaseUnsupervised_deepfake_idempotence
theoretically (D1,D2) should be low than (D11,D22), so we are not getting actual measure

First I trained to separate (Obama and fake Obama)
then using swapped data
Then I trained to separate (Mushfiq and Obama(Mushfiq))

So, D1 can be two types (Mushfiq, Obama) (D1 and D11)


Data swapped means mushfiq and Obama(Mushfiq)
else Obama and Obama(Obama)

We want to increse distnace for both (Obama, fake obama) and (Mushfiq, Obama(Mushfiq))
